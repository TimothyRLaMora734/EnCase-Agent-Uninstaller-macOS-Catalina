# EnCase-Agent-Uninstaller-macOS-Catalina

This is a signed, notarized uninstaller PKG file for the EnCase Enterprise/Direct agent installed on macOS 10.15 (Catalina).

It is not an official OpenText product and consists solely of a `postinstall` script, which is rudimentary in nature.

The script performs no validation nor will it report anything other than a successful execution.
